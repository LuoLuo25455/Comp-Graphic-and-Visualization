# How do I approach designing software?
- Before this course, I have never learned anything with regards to computer graphics. This course has greatly helped with my understanding of OpenGL and other graphics softwares and opened up my mind in graphics with coding.
- The overall design process was to start off by observing real life scenarios and then fix a perspective by taking pictures, and finally use coding techniques to mimick the object in the pitures.
- In the future I would like to find some pictures that would be more realistically be achieved within a short period of time. For this project I started off with a picture that had too many elements but in the future I would choose something more attainable.

# How do I approach developing programs?
- Initially I was trying to incorporate everything within a single main function. Gradually as I learned more, I started to incoporate my own variables and custom functions that could help me with approaching my project more efficiently.
- Iteration helped with memory consolidation, both mentally and physically. Sometimes whenever I saw a challenge to be conquered, my mind might be empty about how to approach to this problem but my muscle memory started to type some preliminary code that helped me to make the first step.
- Milestones were usually checkpoints for me to inspect how much I have learned so far and how I could incorporate everything I have learned into my final project. Initially I only viewed these assignments as separate things but now I view them as an entirely.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- From an educational perspective, I have learned about OpenGL and I could utilize this knowledge in the future if I choose to learn more graphics-related tools like Unreal or Unity.
- From a professional perspective, having the skills of designing code-based graphics is essential to become a professional and effecient software engineer and developer.
